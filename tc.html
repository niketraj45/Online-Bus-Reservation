	 		 <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
	 	    <p><h3>Payment Options</h3> <br>
<h4>1. Online Card Payments</h4><br>
Visa, Master and American Express Card payments are processed through an online payment gateway system. You need not worry about your 
card information falling into the wrong hands because your bank will authorize the card transaction directly without any information passing
 through us. In approximately 25-30 seconds (depending on your internet connection) your bank will issue, using the online payment gateway,
 an authorization code and confirmation of completion of transaction.
<br>
Star Bus, as a Verisign Certified Site, uses the latest 128 bit encryption technology and other sophisticated methods to protect your credit card
 information. You can book your product using SSL encryption (the internet standard for secure transactions). In fact, transacting online with
 a credit card at the website is even safer than using a credit card at a restaurant because we do not retain your credit card information. 
You can be assured that Star Bus offers you the highest standards of security currently available on the internet so as to ensure that your 
shopping experience is private, safe and secure.
<br>
If the payment on the credit card is declined for some reason, alternate payment instructions must be received by Star Bus 72 hours prior to 
the time of departure; else, the order is liable to be cancelled.
<br>
Star Bus charges a service fee on all Bus bookings. In case of cancellation of booking, this fee is non-refundable.
